Using SAS Studio


Try Using SAS Studio

In this short exercise, you try the programming tasks you'll perform in this course - you browse data, submit code, check the log, and view results. If you are new to programming with SAS Studio, click the Show Solution button and follow the steps.

    Open SAS Studio.

    Open the Cars data set in the Sashelp library and browse the data. How many rows are in the data set?
        Click Libraries in the navigation panel and open the Sashelp library, then open the Cars data.
        Scroll through the data. There are 428 rows in the Cars data set.
        Close the data viewer.

    The example program below creates a report that lists the number and percentage of each type of car in the data set Sashelp.Cars. Copy and paste the program into the Editor window and submit it.

    title "Car Inventory by Type";
    proc freq data=sashelp.cars;
       tables Type / nocum;
    run;
    title;

        Copy the code (highlight the code and press Crtl-C) and paste it (press Ctrl-V) into the Code tab.
        Click the Run button to submit the code to SAS.

    View the log to verify that the code ran successfully. What note do you see?
        Click the Log tab.
        Check the Log Summary to be sure that there are no warning or error messages in the log. In the list of notes, you should see the following note:
        There were 428 observations read from the data set SASHELP.CARS.

    View the results. The Frequency column represents the number of each type of car. Which type had the highest number of cars in the data?
        Click the Results tab.
        In this data set, most cars have the type Sedan -- 262 sedans accounted for about 61% of the cars in the data.
